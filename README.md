# Work Day Scheduler 


This application is a scheduler that displays the current date at the top of the page underneath the title.  

When you scroll, there is a box with time blocks for each hour of the day, starting from 9AM until 5PM.  The user can add text to each area and the input is saved using local storage, so it's saved if the user refreshes the page.  

The time is color coded, so if the hour is in the past, its background color is gray, the present hour time block is shown in red, and the future blocks are shown in green.
